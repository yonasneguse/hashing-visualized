# hashing visualized
 
This code allows for user input, and allows different hashing functions and collision resolution techniques to be visualized in the output.

The program allows for the user to input the size of the hash table.

The program allows for these hashing functions:
``
Modulo, Multiplication, Universal Hashing, and a Customer Hash Function (user input)
``

The program allows for these collision resolution techniques:
``
Changing, Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, and Double Hashing
``

The program continues by asking the user for their choice of key along with the value to be stored at that key. After every insertion, the program displays the status of the hash table, along with key characteristics (load factor, # of collisions).

The program continues to insert until the user inputs the value -1.
